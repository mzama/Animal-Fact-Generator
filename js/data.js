            "factBody":"Platypuses have almost 40'000 specialised cells in their bill that detect the electrical fields generated by the muscles of other animals. The rivers where they live are so murky that hunting by sight is impossible, but following these electrical signals allows them to track their prey. While some other animals, such as eels, fish, sharks, and even bees can also detect electrical signals, platypuses are one of only 3 mammals with this ability. This adaptations is much more helpful in aquatic rather than terresterial environments.",
